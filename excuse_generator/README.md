# Python Hello

The most basic boilerplate to start a Python project at 4Geeks is to start your very first Python project from scratch.

## What to do next?

Open the `main.py` file and start writing your code.

Execute your code by typing the following command on your terminal:

```bash
$ python main.py
```

You can create and include as many python files (a.k.a. modules) as you want using the import statements.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed in your computer. We strongly recommend [installing Python through Pyenv ](https://4geeks.com/how-to/what-is-pyenv-and-how-to-install-pyenv) to avoid version conflicts in the future.
